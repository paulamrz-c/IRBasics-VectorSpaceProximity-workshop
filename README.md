#  IR Basics Vector Space Proximity Workshop

## Overview
 
This workshop implements a **NLP pipeline**, focusing on **six foundational** concepts in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to prepare for Vector Space Models and Cosine Similarity:

  1. Term-Document Incidence Matrix
  2. Term Frequency (TF)
  3. Log Frequency Weight
  4. Document Frequency (DF)
  5. Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)
  6. TF-IDF Weighting
 
The notebook also combines hands-on coding, markdown explanations, and collaborative peer review.

##  Features
 
- Build a complete NLP pipeline: document collection, tokenization, normalization, and vectorization.
- Implement six core NLP concepts: Term-Document Incidence Matrix, TF, Log Frequency Weight, DF, IDF, and TF-IDF.
- Test each concept with phrase queries and interpret results.
- Practice collaborative coding, debugging, and peer feedback using Git and GitHub.
